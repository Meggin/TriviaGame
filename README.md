# TriviaGame

This week's challenge was fun!

After struggling last week building the [Star Wars Game](https://github.com/Meggin/week-4-game),
this week I started off spending a full day writing [detailed pseudocode](https://github.com/Meggin/TriviaGame/commit/d8b9943c7dea92ae77503d099806468b4607f006).

This made a massive difference in being able to write code in baby steps.

I also made sure to refactor along the way, chunking up code into smaller and smaller bits.

This made a massive difference in being able to test my code using Dev Tools debugger.

And finally, I worked hard to get a nearly functioning app by Thursday, so that Friday could be a fun polish day.

Interesting enough, my daughter got a vomiting bug, and I managed to make the game responsive while nursing a puking child: [https://safe-harbor-53946.herokuapp.com/](https://safe-harbor-53946.herokuapp.com/)

I learned a couple of very cool things this week, worth calling out:

* How to use a custom font downloaded from the web using [FONT SQUIRREL](https://www.fontsquirrel.com/tools/webfont-generator).

* How to use Chrome Dev Tools [Media Query Bar](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/device-mode/emulate-mobile-viewports#media-queries), so that I can test larger screen sizes.

* How to see the values of variables in Chrome Dev Tools, paying attention to Global and Local distinctions.

I also learned how to how to better structure my JavaScript. I asked a JavaScript engineer to look at my very poorly structured JS in [Star Wars Game](https://desolate-taiga-32749.herokuapp.com/), and give me some pointers on what to do differently next time. Out of this, I learned to put as little as possible in the document.ready(). I learned to write very small functions, even one liners, if possible. I learned to pay attention to declaring variables (especially remembering to put 'var' before i in for loops).

Onwards to next week!
